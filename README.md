# TutorApp
Tutoring app made in android for Fundamentals of Software Engineering course. No one in the team had any previous Android experience prior to developing this app. Firebase was used for the login authentication and real-time database.

Majority of coding and implementation was done in around two weeks time. Some features were not fully implemented or polished due to the strict time constraints and limited resources.

***Features***
* Android 5.0 and up compatible
* Firebase login and registration authentication
* Firebase database
* Material design and animations
